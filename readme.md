## [WIP<sup>tm</sup>] Controlify

Some effort of making the 'button' using fltk + rust available on *-rs-fltk dir. -- soon will be focusing making QML widget instead.

https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli must installed first to allow injection of js file to spotify desktop. These js file also heavily reliant on spicetify injected API so maybe if something is wrong probably coming from either upstream (Spotify devs) or spicetify.
